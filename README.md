Project Title: Online Auction System

Description:
This repository contains the solution for the Database Design and Implementation course project, completed during ITCS 3160-002 in Spring 2024. The project focuses on developing a database system for an online auction platform, adhering to industry best practices for software development.

Objectives:

Organized, planned, and executed a database application development initiative, including defining requirements and planning development phases.
Created Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) to represent high-level data relationships and translated conceptual models into physical database schemas.
Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a database application, encompassing overall architecture, relational schema, database interaction code, and deployment in a testing environment.
Installed, configured, and managed a PostgreSQL relational DBMS, including routine tasks such as creating databases, users, backups, restores, and security configurations.
Coded client and server-side in SQL and PL/pgSQL, including writing SQL queries, stored procedures, functions, and triggers to automate database actions.
Quality Attributes:

Ensured logical and physical design integrity, maintaining a well-organized and normalized database schema.
Utilized PostgreSQL as a robust transactional DBMS to ensure ACID properties and data integrity.
Implemented a REST API-based application architecture for seamless communication between components.
Leveraged SQL and PL/pgSQL for efficient and reusable database functions.
Managed transactions and concurrency effectively, including isolation levels and handling of concurrent transactions.
Developed error avoidance and detection mechanisms through input validation, referential integrity, and comprehensive error logging.
Provided thorough documentation for the database schema and application, facilitating understanding and maintenance.
Functional Description:
The system enables users to initiate, participate in, and manage auctions through a REST API, supporting functionalities such as user authentication, auction creation, bidding, messaging, and auction management.
